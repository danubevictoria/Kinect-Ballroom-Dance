<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h3>
<p>Our Kinect application is called Kinect Ballroom Dance, which is designed for beginning ballroom dancers to get a similar kind of feedback as they would normally get from a dance instructor or partner, allowing them to practice their dance moves and learn new ones. The purpose of the experiment is to test the user's ability to successfully complete the three tasks (easy, medium, hard), gain feedback on how to improve the usability of our application, ensure that the user is receiving adequate enough feedback, and ensure that useful and necessary information is shown on the screen.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Implementation_and_Improvements">Implementation and Improvements</span></h3>
<ul><li> Added Instructional video where previous "INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO" placeholder text existed, and looped instructional videos
</li><li> Labelled left and right foot ovals with "L" and "R" respectively (previously it was difficult to tell right foot from left)
</li><li> Added speech synthesis to read feedback text out loud in case user is (a) not paying attention to feedback or (b) is turned around and cannot see the feedback
</li><li> Changed menu system to incorporate Back Button instead of a separate gesture to go backwards in the menu
</li><li> Made interaction with menus only possible when user is between 1 and 3 meters away from Kinect, so that when they chose to do a dance they were the correct distance for our app to recognize all their movements
</li><li> Changed feedback pause screen to fade in instead of appear suddenly
</li><li> Changed foot pattern arrows to depend on the length of the user's lower leg so that movements would relative to the user's body
</li><li> Changed the length of time the feedback is displayed before checking the skeleton again
</li><li> Posture lesson now ends and transitions to the feedback pause screen after holding a perfect posture for a set amount of time
</li><li> Foot pattern arrows not have a transparent background instead of a white background and the foot can now be seen underneath the arrows
</li><li> Changed the leniency of posture checks so that users will receive positive feedback even if they are only slightly off from the intended position
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Method">Method </span></h3>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Participants">Participants</span></h4>
<p>Participants were volunteers who were beginning ballroom dancers from the UC Berkeley Ballroom Dance team. Participants who were selected expressed interest in our application, so they were excited about testing our prototype (and coincidentally tended to be Computer Science majors).

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Apparatus">Apparatus</span></h4>
<p>We tested users in Cory. At first we used one of the group members computers but realized it would be easier for the user to read what was on the screen if the screen was larger so we went into an empty classroom and used the projector.  We also used a Kinect and laptop during the pilot study. We used a tripod and a video camera to record the user during the study.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tasks">Tasks</span></h4>
<p><b>EASY - Learn standard ballroom frame/posture (i.e. how you are supposed to look when dancing)</b>
In this task the user follows instruction from an instructional video while receiving text feedback about their body positioning in order to practice and improve their standard ballroom posture, a static position.  Feedback includes messages such as "Raise your right elbow" and "Remember to stand up straight" depending on the positioning of the user.  During the testing of this task we were interested in how well the user was interacting with the information displayed in the feedback section.  We were interested in whether the user looked at the video feed of himself.  We were also interested in the quality of our feedback text - whether certain messages were displayed at the correct time and whether these messages were phrased in a way which made sense to the user.
</p><p><b>MODERATE - Learn a basic stationary (non-traveling) dance figure (Closed Change figure in Waltz)</b>
Our moderate task involves dancing the closed change figure in Waltz, which requires keeping posture while moving. In this task the user's feet positions are displayed on the screen such that when the user's feet move forward the image of the user's feet move up higher in the y direction. In this way the user can see what their feet are doing as they move around.  Arrows appear by the user's feet and disappear as the user performs the correct corresponding motion.  Our moderate task includes only 3 steps for the user to follow.  During the testing of this task we were interested in how well the user was able to follow the directions on the screen for feet movement and weight change.  We were interested in whether or not the users continued to look at the feedback text.  We were also interested in whether the users looked at themselves in the color feed.
</p><p><b>DIFFICULT - Learn a dance sequence (Cha-cha New Yorker)</b>
Our difficult task is dancing a Cha-cha New Yorker sequence. The sequence is more difficult than a single figure, as in the moderate task, because it involves dancing multiple dance figures back-to-back, including a turn. As in the moderate task, the user's feet are displayed and the user follows direction from arrows which appear near the images of the user's feet.  During the testing of this task we were interested in how well the user was able to follow the directions on the screen for feet movement and weight change.  The steps displayed on the screen for this task are more difficult so we were interested in how the users would react the more complicated arrows which indicate things such as turning and crossing a leg over.  We were interested in whether or not the users continued to look at the feedback text.  We were also interested in whether the users looked at themselves in the color feed.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Procedure">Procedure</span></h4>
<p>For each tester we first had the person sign a consent form. After this Danube read them a script giving them information about the tasks we wanted them to perform and how to do navigation gestures.  We made sure to emphasize that the tester should think aloud.  You can read this document in the appendices section of our wiki.  Each user test was recorded and notes were also taken during the testing.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_we_learned_from_the_user_study">What we learned from the user study</span></h4>
<ul><li>Based on the number of errors made by 2 of our participants when navigating the menu, we learned that navigating the menu is difficult. Our gestures for selecting and for going back are too similar (raising hand next to head and raising hand above head. We need to have different gestures for navigating the menu.  We think we should add a back button so that the gestures are no longer too similar to each other.  We also feel that it would be useful to users to have a tutorial on how to navigate through the menu.  One user tried to make a pushing gesture to select even though we told her selecting was only raising your hand, which was interesting, and we may change the gesture to a pushing gesture.
</li><li>We told users which tasks to perform and then had them find those tasks by navigating through the menu.  All users were able to find them without a problem, which tells us that our menu is organized nicely. Users were able to spend the majority of the time completing the task and not on navigating the menu.
</li><li>A problem which came up a few times during testing was that of the user not standing a correct distance from the kinect in order for it to read them properly.  In once case, the user was too far for his feet to show up on the feet view which caused a bug.  We need to have something which checks to see that the user is standing at a good distance away from the kinect before beginning a lesson.  If the user is too far or too close, we can ask them to move forward or backwards.
</li><li>It seems that users are somewhat unclear about when to end the posture lesson.  Right now we have it set up so that the user can practice and receive feedback for as long as she likes and choose to end when she is finished by performing the pause/quit gesture.  However, there is no indication that this gesture is available on the display so the testers seemed confused about when to stop.  We plan on adding a reminder on the display telling the user that they can quit.  We also plan on quitting for the user automatically if they hold a correct posture with no needed adjustments for a certain amount of time, probably somewhere around 10 seconds.
</li><li>A user expressed frustration at the feedback that his feet were not close enough together while performing his posture.  He said that he usually keeps his feet slightly further apart.  We have decided to allow users to keep their feet slightly further apart than we had previously.
</li><li>Users like the feet view of the dance lessons.  We would like to make it look even nicer if we have the opportunity - but this is a lower priority fix for us.
</li><li>One or two of our arrows have a white background and when the user moves her foot past the arrow you cannot see her foot.  If she stops in just the right place the arrow disappears.  We can fix this by displaying feet above arrows at all times and/or by not having a white background on the arrow images
</li><li>Depending on the user, arrows may be too large.  Some people need to take smaller steps than others depending on the length of their leg.  We could improve the accuracy of our arrows by calculating the length that they ought to be based on the users body/leg length.
</li><li>One thing we check for while checking posture is whether the person is standing up straight.  It seems that this check works very well on some people but somewhat poorly on others.  We need to look into this more and debug this functionality so that it performs better overall.
</li><li>Right now the feedback is displayed for a few seconds at a time so that we do not have flickering feedback messages.  This is an improvement to previous versions of our prototype where it was difficult to read the feedback messages because they would change so quickly.  However, now the feedback is a tiny bit slow to update.  We would like for the feedback to reflect immediately when the user resolves a problem with posture, but right now there is a small delay.
</li><li>We have a message that is given to users who are holding their right hand too close to their chest when practicing posture.  The message reads, "Bring your right hand out further."  One user was confused by this message.  We are going to change it to read "Bring your right hand out further in front of you" in order to make it more clear.
</li><li>Users found the instructions for a step on our difficult task somewhat unclear.  (The step involves crossing one foot over and turning on the other foot simultaneously).  We believe adding instructional videos will make this much easier for users to understand.  Most of our participants suggested that we add an instructional video, which is something we intend to have but have yet to implement. Implementing this is now high priority.
